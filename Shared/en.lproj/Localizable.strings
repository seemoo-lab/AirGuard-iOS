Trackers are for example the Apple AirTag, Samsung SmartTag and Tile Mate. We want to evaluate how well we can protect people from being tracked with our app.

You can use the app without participating in the study. If you participate, the following conditions apply:

**Data collected**
• Information about the devices found, such as the type of device, signal strength, and date and time.
• We log when the app sends you a notification, the date and time of it

Information shared voluntarily
• Age, gender and location (country, state)
• Locations where you found a tracker.

**Duration of the study**
• As long as you have installed the app and want to participate in the study.
• You can stop participating at any time in the settings.

**Deletion of data**
You can request deletion of your data by email. To do so, they need to copy your ID for identification from the app and provide it to us. We can then delete the data set associated with you.

**Data processing**
All data is treated confidentially and stored on servers of the TU Darmstadt. No other persons outside of SEEMOO at TU Darmstadt will have access. An identification of the individual participants is not possible. There are no risks associated with participation. The data processing of this study is carried out according to the data protection regulations of the German Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) and the Hessian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act (HDSIG). The data will be used exclusively for the purposes described in the informed consent form.

If you participate in the study, you confirm that you are older than 18 years of age and have read this consent form.

In the following, you will learn which trackers AirGuard can automatically detect in the background and which trackers are visible using the manual scan.

**Samsung SmartTags**
These tags are made by Samsung and work almost the same as AirTags.

*Automatic tracking alert* ✅
*Manual Scan* ✅

**Google Find My Device Trackers**
These are trackers that are compatible with Googles's Find My Device network, but are made by other manufacturers. There are a few manufacturers that make such trackers, for example Chipolo, Eufy, Jio, and Pebblebee.

*Automatic tracking alert* ✅
*Manual Scan* ✅

**Tile Trackers**
Tile is a company that exclusively makes Bluetooth trackers. These also have similar features to AirTags.

*Automatic tracking alert* ✅
*Manual scanning* ✅

**Chipolo Trackers (without Find My)**
Chipolo offers Find My trackers that only work with iPhones and trackers that also work with Android devices. Here we cover the trackers that are also compatible with Android phones.

*Automatic tracking alert* ✅
*Manual Scan* ✅

**Pebblebee Tracker (without Find My)**
Pebblebee trackers are available for both the Apple and Google networks. However, Pebblebee also offers the option of operating the trackers in the Pebblebee network. The trackers are also recognized by AirGuard in this mode.

*Automatic tracking alert* ✅
*Manual Scan* ✅

**Samsung Find My Mobile Tracker**
Like Samsung SmartTags, Find My Mobile trackers are operated via the Samsung SmartThings Find network. Find My Mobile trackers can be, for example, Samsung smartphones in offline mode or other devices such as wireless headphones
.  
*Automatic tracking alert* ✅
*Manual Scan* ✅

**Apple AirTags**
AirTags are Apple's trackers. As a result, they are only detectable to a limited extent, as many signals are filtered by the system. In the manual scan we can find AirTags and you can locate them. Tracking detection in the background is already provided by the Apple Find My App.

*Automatic tracking alert* ❌
*Manual Scan* ✅

**Apple Find My Tracker**
These are trackers that are compatible with Apple's Find My, but come from other manufacturers. There are a few manufacturers that make such trackers: Chipolo, Pebblebee, Atuvos, etc. As with AirTags, the tracker cannot be detected in the background. Again, the Find My app automatically warns you.

*Automatic tracking alert* ❌
*Manual Scan* ✅

Note that it is not currently possible for all tracker typed to determine whether they are connected to their owner. Thus, you might see your own or friends' trackers.\n\nAlso, it's important to know that some trackers randomly change their identity (Bluetooth MAC address) a couple of times a day. As a result, one tracker could be displayed multiple times in the app. That's because it's often not possible to match the different, randomized identities.

Also make sure you don't move to another location until you disabled it.

"article_faq_text" = "In this article, we have compiled some of the frequently asked questions.

**I found trackers via the Manual Scan, should I be worried?**
*The trackers you see in manual scan are only the trackers which are around you. They are not necessarily tracking you. AirGuard will only notify you if those trackers travelled with you. If that is not the case, there usually is nothing to worry about.*

**I get notifications for my own trackers. Can I ignore or name them?**
*For technical reasons, ignoring trackers is only possible for Tile trackers. Trackers cannot be named.*

**Why can AirTags only be found in the Manual Scan?**
*This is due to technical reasons. Unfortunately, this will not change in the foreseeable future. However, the pre-installed \"Find My\" app already protects against such devices.*

**Why are devices that are connected to their owners harmless?**
*If the devices are connected to their owners, they are in a state where they cannot send locations on their own. Thus, they cannot be used for stalking.*

**Why are my own AirTags not displayed?**
*Your own AirTags may sometimes not be displayed in the app. However, AirTags are always reliably displayed when linked to another Apple ID and not connected to an owner device.*

**Why are some trackers displayed twice?**
*Some trackers change their identity (Bluetooth address) at certain intervals. This means that they cannot always be correlated, which is why some trackers may be displayed twice.*

**How much power does AirGuard consume?**
*The app consumes very little power. With normal use of the device, no difference will be noticeable, power consumption is usually less than 1%.*

**Will the app remain free forever?**
*Yes, the app will be offered for free forever.*

Key Points:

* How prevalent is stalking via location tracking?
* How can we better protect individuals from such threats?
* What would help you the most?

We ask everyone to participate, whether you've personally encountered such incidents or not. Your contribution will help us gain a broader understanding of the situation and devise more effective countermeasures.
